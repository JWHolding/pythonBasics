# An example ATM application.
## Based roughly on Gareth's usual spec.

Probably a horrible example of OOP in python but getting along there slightly

1. This should not be taken as a finished product, it is very much a work in progress
2. I am still learning Python to it is likely to be rubbish
3. I need to workout how I will do the login functionality
4. an example bit of markdown
